# About-me-Log

Hi! I'm NovaLyonix, but you can't call me Nova or Lyon. This will be a repository I'll use for a personal journal where I'll write down my thoughts, ideas, and learning concepts about dev :3
Telling you a little more about myself:

I hope to become a great video game developer and artist. I know about Blender, video editors, and game engines, but the truth is, I want to be a developer, haha.
I started with C++, then learned web languages ​​(HTML, CSS, JS, PHP), and after that, the rest of the C family (C# and Cpure).
And since I had personal projects, I learned GML, GDScript, and C# geared towards video game design.
For now, I don't know anything about frameworks, and that will stay the case for a while. Right now, I'm exploring languages ​​in their pure form, especially JavaScript.
I have very little knowledge of GitHub and social media for programming, so it will probably take me some time to feel confident in my projects (yes, I'm very insecure, hehe).
But I'll soon be uploading two projects I did in college; they'll be the first ones :3
